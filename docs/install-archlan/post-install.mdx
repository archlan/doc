# Post Installation
>This section regroups what I recommend you do after installing ArchLan on your machine

:::note
Don't forget that some tasks are automatically done by the [ArchLan hooks](https://github.com/archlan/core/tree/main/archlan-hooks) right
after the installation, which means that some of the things recommended to do
are already done.
:::

## Update ArchLan
Refresh the package database and update it.
```bash
$ sudo pacman -Syyu
```

If you get such an error
```bash
error: archlan-packages: signature from "Lanhild (ArchLan Linux PGP key, made by @Lanhild.) <archlan@protonmail.com>" is unknown trust
error: failed to synchronize all databases (invalid or corrupted database (PGP signature))
```
Follow [these instructions](https://archlan.github.io/documentation/blog/01-post-packages) in order the fix it.

## Remove unnecessary dependencies
It is possible that once you have installed ArchLan on your machine, there are
unnecessary dependencies left. In order to remove them, do this:
```bash
# This will remove the orphaned packages (or unnecessary depends) installed on the system.
$ sudo pacman -Rs $(pacman -Qdtq)
```

## Install your favorite applications
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S package-name
```

## Graphics issue

In the case you encounter screen tearing, try to do this:

1. Enable the `GLX` backend for the compositor.
>Edit `~/.config/i3/picom.conf` and put `glx` as the rendering backend

2. In the case the first option didn't work, create an `xorg.conf` failed
```bash
# Go to the X11 config dir
$ cd /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d

# Create the config file and edit it
$ sudo vim 20-amdgpu.conf
```

Then paste this section into the file`
```bash
Section "Device"
    Identifier "AMD"
    Driver "amdgpu"
    Option "TearFree" "true"
EndSection
```
:::info
This method might not work either. It may prevent you from booting into **xorg**.
Make sure you are able to use a **tty** or that you know how to boot into **recovery mode**
to revert the changes and fix the issue.
:::

## Summary
This is pretty much all you have to do right after installing ArchLan. I will 
most certainly modify or add sections to this category progressively.
