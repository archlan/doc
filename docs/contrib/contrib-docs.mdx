# Improve the Documentation
>This section regroups the guidelines that should be followed to add elements to the ArchLan Linux documentation.

## Prerequisites
- To work locally, [setup](./setup-env) a local development environment on your machine.
- Ensure to have basic understandings of the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) syntaxes. See [Docusaurus Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for further information.
- Make sure that you have the ability to _fork, clone_ a repository and create a _pull request_.


## Files structure and base format

The **docs** directory contains subdirectories (each subdirectory is a section) that regroup the `.md` and `.mdx` files for all of the wiki posts. The `_category_.json` file is used for ordering the docs categories.

- `_category_.json` file detemines the label and position of each categories on the side menu.
- Example using the `Contribute` section of the documentation.

```bash
docs    # Main Directory
└── contrib                           # Category
   ├── _category_.json                # Label and category position
   ├── contrib-blog.mdx               # Documentation Page
   ├── contrib-docs.mdx               # Documentation Page
   └── setup-env.mdx                  # Documentation Page
```

## Heading format

In the `heading`, you have to specify the position of the category.
