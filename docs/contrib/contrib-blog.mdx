# Add Tutorials
>This section regroups the guidelines that should be followed to write a tutorial for the ArchLan Linux documentation.

## Prerequisites
- To work locally, [setup](./setup-env) a local development environment on your machine.
- Ensure to have basic understandings of the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) syntaxes. See [Docusaurus Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for further information.
- Make sure that you have the ability to _fork, clone_ a repository and create a _pull request_.

## Format structure and file organization

All the `.md` and `.mdx` files for tutorials are contained within the blog directory.

- Simply create a new file with the appropriate format to add a tutorial to the wiki.

```bash
YEAR    # Directory
├── month-day-post-NAME.mdx     # .md or .mdx file
└── month-day                   # Directory
   ├── Images                   # Directory
   └── post-NAME.mdx            # .md or .mdx file
```

## Create tags and titles

Add the correct slug, tags and title in the heading of the file you want to add.

```yml
---
slug: NUM-post-NAME
title: TITLE
authors: ID
tags: [TAG1, TAG2, TAG3]
---
```
