## dd `Linux`

:::danger
Use this method only if you know what you are doing, since a simple typo mistake with `dd` can make irrecoverable damages to your disk drive.
:::

If you currently are on a Linux machine, you can use the command line utility `dd`. You can create both BIOS and UEFI bootbale USB sticks using this method. Follow the steps down below to make a bootable ArchLan USB with dd:

- Run `sudo fdisk -l` to get the information about your USB drive and it's path. In this specific case, the path is `/dev/sdb`

```bash
$ sudo fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sdb: 3,73 GiB, 4009754624 bytes, 7831552 sectors
Disk model: DT 101 II
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0xa6af67e1
```

You can also find the path of your USB by running the command `lsblk`

```bash
$ lsblk

NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sdb           8:16   1   3.7G  0 disk
nvme0n1     259:0    0 119.2G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0 115.2G  0 part /
└─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0     4G  0 part
...
```

- When you found the correct path, Run `dd` to flash the ISO to the USB.

```bash
$ sudo dd bs=4M if=path/to/archlan.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress oflag=sync
```

- Before running the command, make sure to replace **/path/to/archlan.iso** with the ArchLan ISO path and also **/dev/sdX** with your USB device path.
- When the process will be done, the ArchLan USB will be botbale for both BIOS and UEFI modes.

## Etcher `Linux`, `Mac`, `Windows`

:::note
[Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) can flash an OS image (ISO) to an SDCard or USB to make it bootable. This is the **easiest and simplest method** to make an ArchLan bootable USB for beginners.
:::

1. Install [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for your operating system.
1. Open the balenaEtcher application and click **Select Image**. Select the ArchLan Linux ISO file.
1. Choose your target USB stick. **CAUTION**, ensure you have selected the right one before proceeding to the next step.
1. Select **Flash!** and wait for it to be done.
1. The ArchLan USB will be bootable for both BIOS and UEFI modes.

## Other Options `Linux`
>The following methods copy the ISO file to the USB drive to make it bootable.

- Using `cat` : run ;
```bash
$ sudo cat path/to/archlan.iso > /dev/sdX
```
- Using `cp` : run ;
```bash
$ sudo cp path/to/archlan.iso /dev/sdX
```
- Using `tee` : run ;
```bash
$ sudo tee < path/to/archlan.iso > /dev/sdx
```

Before running the command, make sure to replace **/path/to/archlan.iso** with the ArchLan ISO path and also **/dev/sdX** with your USB device path.
