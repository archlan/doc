# Updating ArchLan packages
>This section lists everything you need to do in order to update an ArchLan official package

## PKGBUILD version

```bash
pkgname="archlan-hooks"
pkgver=1.0              # This changes whether it is a new version or not
pkgrel=2                # Release number
...
```
Just change the release number (increments at each new release)
and also modify the package version depending on if it is a new version or not.
