# Prepare a new release
>This section lists everything that I must take in consideration
>when preparing a new ArchLan release.

## Test the Live ISO
Before continuing to the next steps, make sure to test thoroughly the built ISO
and ensure that there are no unwanted errors or bugs.

>Once tested, push the updates to [archlan/iso](https://github.com/archlan/iso)

## Create the release
- GPG sign the ISO file
```bash
$ gpg --default-key archlan@protonmail.com --output archlan-*-x86_64.iso --detach-sig archlan-*-x86_64.iso
```
- Create the sha256sum file
```bash
$ sudo sha256sum archlan-*-x86_64.iso > archlan-*-x86_64.iso.sha256sum
```

## Upload the files to the git repo
The last step is to create the actual Github release.

- Upload the `sha256sum` and `*.sig` ISO files. The rest should be automatically done by Github.
